I am the Research Lab Lead of the Applied AI in Services Lab at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), where I focus on advancing the collaborative potential of humans and AI in industrial processes. My research emphasizes the development and application of modern data science methods, with a particular interest in how artificial intelligence (AI) can foster knowledge transfer and enable practical, scalable industrial solutions.

My primary goal is to bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI technologies and their real-world applications, ensuring responsible and effective integration into industrial and service systems. To achieve this, I adopt a multidisciplinary approach, combining design-oriented and analytically quantitative methods in my work.

Before my current role, I gained extensive experience in industry through my roles as a Data Scientist at Fujitsu and Trelleborg Sealing Solutions. At Fujitsu, I developed AI-driven solutions for customer projects, including implementing models for smart manufacturing. At Trelleborg, I progressed from Data Scientist to Senior Data Scientist, leading initiatives to create AI frameworks and solutions that addressed real-world challenges in material development and industrial applications. These experiences have deeply informed my academic research, ensuring a strong alignment with industry needs and practical impact.

I am about to complete my PhD at KIT with a dissertation titled "The Impact of Explainable AI on Human Knowledge in Human-AI Interaction." During this time, I had the opportunity to conduct a research stay at Carnegie Mellon University's Human-Computer Interaction Institute, where I explored the downsides of explainable AI in human-AI collaboration. I also collaborated with various industrial partners, addressing challenges in AI adoption, knowledge transfer, and domain adaptation.
